# image-search
My implementation of the Image Search Abstraction Layer project from freeCodeCamp.

[See the app on Heroku]()

Implements the following User stories:
* I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
* I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
* I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
